1. Primitive Value
- String, Numbers, Booleans, null, undefined, Symbol
- Stored in memory (Normally in stack), variable stores
value itself
- Copying a variable (=assign to different variable) copies the value

2. Reference Value
- All other object ("more expensive to create")
- Stored in memory (heap), variable stores a pointer (address) to location in memory
- Copying a variable (=assing to different variable) copies the pointer, not the value itself
